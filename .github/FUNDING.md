# Support Lovable Learner 💙

Lovable Learner is a free, neurodivergent-first learning platform built to help people who don’t learn well from traditional lectures, audio, or one-size-fits-all education.

This project exists because millions of capable people were never taught *how their brains learn*.

Your sponsorship helps:
- Keep the app free and accessible
- Cover AI usage and hosting costs
- Improve learning accessibility for ADHD, Autistic, Dyslexic, and ND learners
- Sustain development without ads, paywalls, or data selling

Lovable Learner is founder-built, mission-driven, and community-supported.

If this project helps you—or someone you care about—thank you for supporting its future ❤️
